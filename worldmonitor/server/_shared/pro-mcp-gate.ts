/**
 * The Pro-MCP access decision, shared by the five entitlement gates listed below.
 *
 * Five call sites previously re-implemented the same four-clause check
 * (`tier >= 1 && mcpAccess === true && validUntil >= now`, plus the null case):
 *
 *   - `api/internal/mcp-grant-context.ts` — renders the consent card
 *   - `api/internal/mcp-grant-mint.ts`    — mints the signed grant
 *   - `api/oauth/authorize-pro.ts`        — finishes authorization on the
 *                                          api subdomain
 *   - `api/mcp/auth.ts`                   — protects MCP-edge requests
 *   - `server/gateway.ts`                 — re-checks signed internal MCP calls
 *
 * The decision lives here so the OAuth handshake cannot authorize an account
 * that the MCP edge or gateway later rejects. Each caller keeps its own response
 * envelope and telemetry (#5622, #5653).
 *
 * What this module owns, precisely: the ACCESS decision, for all five. The
 * `ProMcpGateDenial` union is consumed as a rendered decision only by the three
 * grant-flow callers (via `proMcpGateDenialResponse`). `api/mcp/auth.ts` and
 * `server/gateway.ts` read the return value as pass/deny and render billing
 * denials through their own helpers — which bottom out in the same
 * `entitlement-check.ts::classifyBillingVerification`. That function, not this
 * one, is the single source for billing classification.
 *
 * SCOPE — this does not own every Pro-MCP check in the repo. Two sites still
 * spell the predicate out by hand and are deliberately NOT routed here:
 *
 *   - `server/_shared/premium-check.ts` (internal-MCP trusted-marker branch) —
 *     tier + mcpAccess only, WITHOUT the `validUntil` clause. Safe today because
 *     `server/gateway.ts` is the sole setter of the trusted markers that reach
 *     it and applies this gate — validUntil included — before minting them. It
 *     is a weaker second layer, not a mirror.
 *   - `convex/mcpProTokens.ts::issueProMcpToken` — all four clauses, kept inline
 *     because the Convex runtime does not import from `server/_shared`.
 *
 * Both are comment-enforced mirrors. Tighten the predicate below and you must
 * check those two by hand; "cannot drift" is a claim about the five above only.

/**

 * Why only one, when the shared contract has three retryable states: the two
 * grant endpoints exist to keep the apex `/mcp-grant` SPA "on a single canonical
 * contract" (see each file's header), and inside an OAuth handshake the only
 * distinction the SPA can act on is retry-vs-don't. The precise reason still
 * travels, in `X-Billing-Verification` and `error_description`, for monitoring
 * and support — it just does not fork the SPA's control flow three ways.
 *
 * `INSUFFICIENT_TIER` deliberately keeps covering a provider-confirmed lapse: it
 * IS a confirmed insufficient tier, retrying cannot fix it, and every existing
 * SPA/consumer branch for that code stays correct. Only the header is added, so
 * a lapse is distinguishable from a plain free account in logs.
